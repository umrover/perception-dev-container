# perception-dev-container
This respoistory contains the container used by Travis to test our code. The container is fractured into 1.5GB chunks, so it can be handled by github. Information on how to do this can be found [here](https://ostechnix.com/split-combine-files-command-line-linux/).

This repository also uses git lfs. Information on this can be found [here](https://git-lfs.github.com/).
